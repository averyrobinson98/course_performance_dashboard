## Course Performance Dashboard
An interactive R Shiny Dashboard to aid UCLA students in making future course decisions. A student who is wondering how they might do in a future course based on their grade in a previous course may enter the courses, along with their course 1 grade, in the top left filter box. They will then be presented with a distribution of course 1 grades, with the black bar indicating their placement in the distribution, and a distribution of course 2 grades for everyone who *also* received the same course 1 grade. Additionally, the student will be able to see, on the righthand side of the dashboard, the most frequent courses taken alongside the course entered as course 2; these courses may be filtered down to students with a specific major, major department, and grade in the first course entered on the left-hand side. Course descriptions and pre-requistes are also listed, if available, and finally, an R-squared value is shown to provide the student an idea of the importance in course 1 grades in explaining and predicting course 2 grades. <br>
